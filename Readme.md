Setting Up OpenAI API with a Spring Boot Application :
1. Access the OpenAI API Platform
   Go to the OpenAI home page.

Click on Login and select the API Platform.

2. Set Up Billing
   Note: The OpenAI API is not free.

Navigate to the Billing section and add credits to your account.

3. Generate an API Key
   Go to the API Keys section in your OpenAI dashboard.

Click Create new secret key.

Copy the generated key and add it to your application.properties file:

properties

openai.api.key=your-api-key-here

4. Create a REST Controller in Spring Boot
   Create a controller class and define a GET endpoint.

Accept a path parameter (e.g., a prompt) through Postman.

5. Integrate the Chat Model
   Use the Chat model (like gpt-3.5-turbo) to act as a mediator between your Spring Boot application and the OpenAI API.

Youâ€™ll send the user's prompt to the chat model and return the response.

6. Testing the Endpoint
   Use Postman to test your endpoint.

Example request:
GET http://localhost:8080/api/tell%20me%20a%20tech%20joke
